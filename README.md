#Sprock-Rock-
A variant of the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, often called "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock." This expanded version was popularized by the TV show The Big Bang Theory and adds two more elements to the original three.

The rules are as follows:

Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
Rock crushes Scissors


Each player selects one of the five options, and the winner is determined based on these rules. It's a fun way to add more variety and complexity to the classic game!
